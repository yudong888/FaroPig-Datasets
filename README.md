Datasets for pig re-identification and related tasks

There are two datasets in total for the project:
1. FaroPigReID-33
   This dataset is created for pig re-identification task, and it consists of 33 identities of mature pigs with around 300 to 4000 masks per individual.

2. FaroPigSeg
   This dataset is created for pig instance segmentation task, and it consists of 1518 images annotated with masks. The images covers 3 production cycles (one year) of a commercial wean to finish farm.

We are now in the process of some legal paperwork for making the datasets public and will release the datasets as soon as possible...
